# Angular Signals State Management (Shorter Version)

Example of State Management using pure signals.
This version compares to:

* [Angular Signals State Managemnent](https://github.com/angularexample/angular-signals-state-management)

The difference is that in this version the store methods, actions, reducers, and effects, are collapsed into single methods. 

Also, the facade service is removed and the store injected directly into the view component.

This is the simplest version of State Management using Angular Signals.
